# Calindora Follow

Calindora Follow is a tool to constantly upload one's current location to a
compliant web service.

# Usage

Install the application on an Android-compatible device. Once installed, open
the settings menu and enter the URL of a compliant service and the device key
and secret.

# Compliant Services

At this time, the only compliant service has no public-facing interface. This
tool is primarily meant for my own personal use. If you really want to
experiment with it anyway, feel free to contact me.
